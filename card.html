			<p id = "bio">The domestic cat is a very interesting and lovable animal.
				They are independent and will demand what they want, whether it be food,
				attention, or personal space. Cats like to take many short naps during
				the day, hence the expression ”cat nap.” Where they choose to sleep varies
				with their personality. Some like to sleep in places like under the bed,
				away from any chaos, while others like to be right amongst
				all the action.</p>
